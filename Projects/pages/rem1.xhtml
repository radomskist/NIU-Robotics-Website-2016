Controllers are one of the most integral components of any robot. While all controllers share some of the same functions, such as containing the programs, data algorithms, and software that enable a robot to function, they also require sensor inputs that give instructions to a microcontroller. The on-board software translates the collected data into radio communications.

This project will facilitate further research into the human interface aspect of robots designed at the collegiate level. Our controllers will be designed and fabricated by team members to be more ergonomic than previous versions, utilize improved custom printed circuit boards and high power radios, and integrate a wide range of robot control functions.
