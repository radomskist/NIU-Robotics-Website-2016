<text>
QUIN 3.0 was our third quadcopter entry into MRDC, hosted by the University of Illinois Urbana/Champaign in March 2015.
<br><br>
QUIN 3.0 was designed with upgraded rotor positions from the normal 90 degree span between props to what is popularly known as the "Dead Cat" position; the back props retain the normal 90 degree separation however the front props are spread much further apart. This new design allows for better stabilization and flight control, while increasing adaptability to manipulator or camera attachment systems.
<br><br>
A modified version of the 3D printed gripper that is comparable to that of NAI was included for performance of competition objectives. With the attached drive train, QUIN 3.0 was able to drive, fly, and pick up the desired objects at competition. QUIN 3.0 was recognized last year for being the best flight sustaining robot the competition has ever seen, competing airborne for over four minutes (out of seven minutes) in a single match.
