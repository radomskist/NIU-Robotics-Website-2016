<text>
QUIN 4.0 is our fourth quadcopter entry into MRDC, hosted annually by University of Illinois Urbana/Champaign in mid March.
<br><br>
The robot is designed to track its position to navigate around the course during competition. This is all possible by a grid of beacons that will bounce back a SONAR signal to the drone. Using this system in conjunction with other sensors, we will be able to accurately locate and manipulate game pieces.
<br><br>
QUIN 4.0 is also a project that includes the design of a simplified suspension system for the quadcopter to land and be ground mobile. While on the ground the quad will switch to RC controls to move around the course, allowing for greater accuracy to grab the game pieces without the interference of propeller propulsion.
