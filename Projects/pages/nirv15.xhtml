<text>
NIRV 1.5 is our second remote controlled ground bot entry into MRDC. The robot will be created mostly by NIU Robotics' newer team members to increase their design experience and introduce them to the unique problems our team faces when integrating several engineering disciplines into a single project.
<br><br>
The robot will use an attached subsystem which will allow for picking up and storing the game objects while not scoring. Additionally, there will be manipulation devices designed to operate hinged and/or pinned doors and ball dispensers within the course.
<br><br>
The chassis for NIRV 1.5 was based upon the chassis of NAI 2.0/2.5. This design has proven to be not only very durable, but also successful in competition and adaptable to a variety of additional subsystems. It will be driven by four custom designed gearboxes and four pneumatic wheels.
