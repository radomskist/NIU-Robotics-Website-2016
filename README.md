## About
This website was a complete overhaul of the Northern Illinois Robotics website to give the framework for club organization along with a more modern and professional appearence. It is written from the ground up in Javascript, PHP, CSS, HTML, and SQL. No other libraries or packages where used outside of the base languages.

## Task system
A task system was created on this website which allowed team leads to create tasks for their robot which other uses could apply for. The team lead could then choose who they wanted to do the task. The task would then appear greyed out, meaning someone was doing it, however in a week the task will turn yellow. When this happens member can apply for the task again and the design lead can choose whether or not to put a new member on the task or refresh the current member. This was put in place for the case of members who would join a task and disappear.

This was all managed with the login and privilage system, which was held on an cpanel server with MySQL installed on it. To sign up a user had to show up to one of our meetings and another user with sufficient privilages (an officer) could open the registration page to allow the user to sign up. This system was put in place so the club wouldn't have a members list overflowing with users who have not even shown upto a single meeting.

Unfortunently, this system was put on the shelf due to the school adding a new requirement that all the clubs must use Microsoft Projects to manage themselves.
